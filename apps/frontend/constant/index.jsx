      'With AkilaChain, users can create(Tokenize), transfer or trade real-world assets such as gold bars, company shares, land deeds, handcrafts, project shares, Energy credits, virtual goods, gift cards or gaming items. You can have the proof of ownership of assets on the chain. The main feature of AkilaChain is that it has unique name for any assets so no two assets can have the same name. Besides, users can generate unique username on system level. So, no need to memorize the addresses to send your tokens. You just send your assets to the names instead of address. Asset creators can send their assets to an address and lock the asset until a date and time passes.',

The holders of a token may be alerted of the vote via the message system, and the vote can be automated from the client or through a web or mobile interface utilizing the protocol included in AkilaChain by automatically issuing a VOTE token to every holder of a token. Tokens are used to symbolize votes in elections. AkilaChain will issue a certain amount of VOTE tokens and distribute them to token holders in a 1:1 ratio. These votes may be delivered to addresses that tally the votes using the protocol. Delegation of votes, also known as Delegative or liquid democracy, is feasible because voting tokens move in the same manner as assets.',

      "A restricted asset is a money or another monetary item put aside for a specific purpose, usually to meet regulatory or contractual obligations. Restricted assets, which are subject to particular accounting rules, are kept apart from other assets to demarcate their intended purpose. Companies in the private sector, non-profit groups, and government agencies all deal with limited assets in different ways. Define a tag to a token so only the tokens can be moved to an address having the tag. There are some for which the buyer's identity is vital. Maybe you don't want your assets to go to an untagged location, or maybe you only want persons called Danial to own #DANIAL/KYCDONE.",

Everyone can grab a copy of the code and setup their own AkilaFediverse server as an instance. The best part is that each AkilaFediverse server can communicate with the others. It means if you signup in one instance, you can still communicate and interact with the others on another one. This model for decentralization is called federated. AkilaFediverse wants to be Another Thing on internet. Decentralized email, Firebase alike protocol, Cryptocurrency wallet, decentralized shopping are some of examples that AkilaFediverse is going to make them happen.',
